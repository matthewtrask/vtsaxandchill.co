          <h3 class="text-center heading">What is VTSAX?</h3>
          <p class="text-center">VTSAX is a Vanguard Mutual Fund you can invest in. To back up. a mutual fund is a fund managed by a broker that pools people's money together. So by buying into VTSAX you join thousands of others doing the same thing.</p>
          <p class="text-center">VTSAX is compromised of the entire stock market. That includes Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Google, Delta, and every other offering in the American Stock Markets.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Instead of trying to bet big on one of those companies above, you are betting on all of them. As <a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com">JL Collins</a> puts it (paraphrasing) "There will always be winners, and there will always be losers. Instead of trying to pick a winner, or avoid a loser, you let the market do it for you".</a></p>

            <h3 class="text-center heading">Is it really that simple?</h3>
            <p class="text-center">Yes. This doesn't mean you can't play the market, but if you want a solid retirement nest egg, putting as much as you can into VTSAX will be a win.</p>
            <p class="text-center">It currently sits at an 18% YTD return. So if you put $10,000 in, it will make you a cool $1,800 in a year. Keep adding those numbers year after year and you can see how it wins.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center heading">How to get started</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Like this whole thing has stated its easy.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Step 1: Open an account at <a href="https://vanguard.com">Vanguard</a>.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Step 2: Move $3,000 into your account.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Step 3: Buy VTSAX</p>
          <p class="text-center">Step infinity: after the initial $3,000 investment, you can add money freely. Be it $10, $100, or more. Just keep adding to your account. Keep it as simple as that.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center heading">What if you can't buy it now?</h3>
            <p class="text-center">Like this whole thing has stated its easy.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Step 1: Open an account at <a href="https://vanguard.com">Vanguard</a>.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Step 2: Move however much you can.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Step 3: Buy VTI</p>
            <p class="text-center">Step infinity: bid your time, putting in money when you can. VTI is an ETF (Electronically Traded Fund) and a mirror image of VTSAX. The difference is that you can automate investments into VTSAX, but not VTI. When you get to the $3,000 minimum, decide if you want to move to VTSAX or stay with VTI. (I would move).</p>
